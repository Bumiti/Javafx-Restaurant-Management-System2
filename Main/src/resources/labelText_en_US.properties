a = Located on the 09th floor, the Gourmet Restaurant is  first ever restaurant, dating back to 2020. \n\n At the time, Ho Chi Minh\u2019s restaurant scene lacked the concept of small sized restaurants which offered a casual fine dining service and outstanding attention to detail. \n Ever since its launch, this venue has been a leading trendsetter in Vietnam\u2019s boutique dining scene. \n A color scheme of steel blue and warm greys complementing dark brown dining furniture and warm lighting engender a cozy sophisticated atmosphere. \n Stunning city views across Le Thi Rieng Park, stretches of the Nhieu Loc - Thi Nghe River and its bridges as well as the Ho Chi Minh\u2019s ever-expanding skylinecreate the perfect backdrop \n particularly at night.  \n\n The Gourmet Corner \n 09th Floor 590 Cach Mang Thang Tam Street \n Seating capacity: 50 \n Lunch \u2013 10:00 - 14:00 \n Dinner 18:00 22:00 \n Last orders: 21:30 \n Open daily \n The Gourmet Corner leads to Diamond Sky Bar 09th-10th floors. \n Note: during holiday periods such as Christmas, New Year, Tet Lunar New Year there will be selected set special menus and we recommend booking in advance.
